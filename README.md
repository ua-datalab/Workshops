# UArizona Data Lab Workshops - Spring 2024

## Introduction to Data Science

### Data Science Essentials: From Jupyter to AI Tools

#### Notes in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ua-datalab/Workshops/wiki).

Do you find yourself encountering data science tools that your research needs, but are unsure how to get started? Curious about the latest tools for organizing, visualizing and understanding your dataset? Are you looking for a better theoretical understanding of key concepts in statistical analysis? 

Join us for this beginner-friendly, concept-focused, and practical introduction to the theory and practice of data science, from start to finish! Sessions cover topics such as data wrangling, statistics, visualization, exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, prompt engineering, and AI tools. 
Enhance your capabilities and take your data science research to the next level!
